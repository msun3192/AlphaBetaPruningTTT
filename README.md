# AlphaBetaPruningTTT
AI plays 3D Tic Tac Toe(4x4x4) using Alpha Beta Pruning and a Board eval function to determine best move and beat opponent(no training phase). 
Demonstrates the performance effect of using optimized searches, and the differences in time complexity between them
Also helped me learn the importance of the evaluation function, and how certain values given to it make the AI prioritize certain board attributes and how those can help it win.
